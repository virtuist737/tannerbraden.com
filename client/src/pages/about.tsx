            I discovered that I am neurodivergent (Level 1 ASD to be specific). Realized that many of my greatest strengths, as well as weaknesses can be explained very well in the context of neurodivergence. Discovered many helpful strategies, like noise reduction and taking more time to be alone. Focusing on how to optimize my life according to my unique set of strengths and weaknesses.

              They say growth happens beyond your comfort zone, and let me tell you, parenthood has been my crash course in personal development. Here are a couple of lessons I've picked up along the way:

              Lesson 1: The Good Father Conundrum
              Initially, I had no clue what it meant to be a great dad, so I played sponge to everyone else's definitions. The problem? Trying and failing to meet these expectations left me feeling like the worst dad on the planet.

              Lesson 2: Energy & Fulfillment
              I discovered a helpful framework for evaluating how I spent my time.

              Lesson 3: Quality Trumps Quantity
              For the longest time, I believed I had to be the ever-present superhero, swooping in to help with everything to prove my love and support.`
