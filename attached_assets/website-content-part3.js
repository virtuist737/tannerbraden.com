      title: "Parenthood (continued)",
      content: `I slowly pieced myself back together into a new man. As I write this, Ryker is around 2.5 years old, and I can proudly say I'm in a much better place now.

They say growth happens beyond your comfort zone, and let me tell you, parenthood has been my crash course in personal development. Here are a couple of lessons I've picked up along the way:

Lesson 1: The Good Father Conundrum
Initially, I had no clue what it meant to be a great dad, so I played sponge to everyone else's definitions. The problem? Trying and failing to meet these expectations left me feeling like the worst dad on the planet. It took some soul-searching, but I finally tossed out the rulebook and redefined fatherhood based on my own set of strengths and weaknesses. The result? My relationship with my wife and son is starting to flourish, the stress and anxiety have diminished, and I'm beginning to really enjoy fatherhood.

Lesson 2: Energy & Fulfillment
I discovered a helpful framework for evaluating how I spent my time. I made a two-axis chart: the X-axis goes from "draining" to "energizing"; and the Y-axis goes from "unfulfilling" to "fulfilling". I then listed out all the things that I spent my time on and mapped them out on the chart. This lead me to a few important discoveries:
- I'd accepted the responsibility to spend a lot of time on things that were draining & unfilfilling. These I needed to outsource to others.
- When I was drained, I was spending a lot of time on things that were entertaining, but that weren't energizing. They just distracted me from how drained I was. These I needed to cut out.
- I'd only discovered a few things that were really energizing and fulfilling. I needed to experiment and find more of these things, and spend more time doing them.

Lesson 3: Quality Trumps Quantity
For the longest time, I believed I had to be the ever-present superhero, swooping in to help with everything to prove my love and support. But here's the kickerâ€”I realized it's not about how much time I spend but the quality of the time I share. My relationships flourish when I dedicate a few hours of genuine love and mindful attention rather than begrudgingly clocking in an entire day. Turns out, love isn't measured in hours; it's the heart-to-heart moments that truly matter.`

      content: `In 2024 I discovered that I am neurodivergent (Level 1 ASD to be specific). Realized that many of my greatest strengths, as well as weaknesses can be explained very well in the context of neurodivergence. Discovered many helpful strategies, like noise reduction and taking more time to be alone. Focusing on how to optimize my life according to my unique set of strengths and weaknesses.`

  summary: `This is just a brief summary, I plan to add more soon.
My driving philosophy is to increase the quality of human consciousness.
There is immense pain and suffering in this world. I believe that no one deserves it, and the vast majority of it is fundamentally avoidable.

I believe I am one of the most fortunate people to have ever lived, and that I have the potential to make a significant contribution to the well-being of humanity. My life is incredible and precious. I don't want to squander it on things that aren't of true value and meaning to me.`,

- While I have little interest in visual art, I deeply enjoy the beauty of nature and music.`
