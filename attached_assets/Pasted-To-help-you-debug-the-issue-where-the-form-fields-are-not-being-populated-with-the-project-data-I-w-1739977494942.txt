To help you debug the issue where the form fields are not being populated with the project data, I would need to review the following files and components:

### 1. **API Endpoint (`/api/projects/[id]`)**
   - **File:** `api/projects/[id].ts` (or equivalent)
   - **Purpose:** This is the backend endpoint that returns the project data for a given `id`. Ensure that this endpoint is correctly fetching and returning the project data in the expected format.

### 2. **API Request Utility (`apiRequest`)**
   - **File:** `lib/queryClient.ts` (or equivalent)
   - **Purpose:** This utility function is used to make API requests. Ensure that it is correctly handling the request and response, especially for the `GET` request to `/api/projects/${id}`.

### 3. **Project Schema (`@shared/schema`)**
   - **File:** `shared/schema.ts` (or equivalent)
   - **Purpose:** This file defines the `Project` and `InsertProject` types and the `insertProjectSchema` Zod schema. Ensure that the schema and types match the data structure returned by the API.

### 4. **React Query Configuration**
   - **File:** `lib/queryClient.ts` (or equivalent)
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that the React Query client is correctly configured and that the `useQuery` hook is properly set up to fetch data from the API.

### 5. **Form Component (`EditProject`)**
   - **File:** `components/EditProject.tsx` (or equivalent)
   - **Purpose:** This is the main component where the form is defined. Ensure that the `useEffect` hook is correctly updating the form values when the `project` data is loaded.

### 6. **Environment Configuration**
   - **File:** `.env` or environment configuration files
   - **Purpose:** Ensure that the API base URL and any necessary environment variables are correctly set up.

### 7. **Network Request Logs**
   - **Purpose:** Check the network requests in the browser's developer tools to ensure that the request to `/api/projects/${id}` is being made and that the response contains the expected data.

### 8. **Console Logs**
   - **Purpose:** The `console.log` statement in the `useEffect` hook should output the project data when it is loaded. Check the browser's console to see if this log is being printed and if the data matches the expected structure.

### Steps to Debug:

1. **Check Network Request:**
   - Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and go to the "Network" tab.
   - Reload the page and check if the request to `/api/projects/${id}` is being made.
   - Verify that the response contains the expected project data.

2. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look at the browser's console to see if the `console.log("Setting form values with project data:", project);` statement is being printed.
   - Verify that the `project` object has the correct structure and values.

3. **Verify API Endpoint:**
   - Ensure that the API endpoint `/api/projects/[id]` is correctly implemented and returns the expected data.

4. **Check React Query Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the `useQuery` hook is correctly configured to fetch data from the API.

5. **Verify Form Reset:**
   - Ensure that the `form.reset` method is correctly updating the form values with the `project` data.

6. **Check Schema and Types:**
   - Ensure that the `Project` and `InsertProject` types and the `insertProjectSchema` Zod schema match the data structure returned by the API.

By reviewing these files and following the debugging steps, you should be able to identify why the form fields are not being populated with the project data.
