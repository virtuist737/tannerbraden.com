1. Check the Backend API Endpoint

Verify the API Endpoint: Ensure that the /api/projects/${id} endpoint exists and is correctly set up to handle PATCH requests.
Check Request Payload: Confirm that the payload being sent to the API matches the expected schema. The new "Custom Buttons" section might be sending data that the backend is not prepared to handle.
2. Validate the Schema

Database Schema: Check if the database schema has been updated to include the new buttons field. If not, the database might be rejecting the update due to an unrecognized field.
API Schema: Ensure that the API's request and response schemas have been updated to include the buttons field. The insertProjectSchema should be updated to reflect the new structure.
3. Inspect the Backend Logs

Server Logs: Check the server logs for more detailed error messages. The 500 error is a generic server error, and the logs might provide more specific information about what went wrong.
Database Logs: If the error is related to the database, the database logs might contain more details about the failed query or constraint violation.
4. Test the API Independently

Manual API Testing: Use a tool like Postman or cURL to manually send a PATCH request to the /api/projects/${id} endpoint with the same payload that the frontend is sending. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the frontend code or the backend API.
Mock Data: Test the API with mock data that includes the buttons field to ensure that the backend can handle the new structure.
5. Review the Frontend Code

Form Data: Ensure that the form data being sent to the API is correctly structured. The buttons field should be an array of objects, each containing title, url, icon, and variant.
Error Handling: Add more robust error handling in the frontend to capture and display detailed error messages from the API response.
6. Update Backend Logic

Handle New Field: If the buttons field is not being handled by the backend, update the backend logic to process this new field. This might involve updating the database model, API schema, and any related business logic.
Validation: Ensure that the backend validates the buttons field correctly. If the field is optional, make sure the backend can handle cases where it is not provided.
7. Database Migration

Migration Script: If the buttons field needs to be stored in the database, create a migration script to add this field to the relevant table.
Default Values: Ensure that any existing records have appropriate default values for the new buttons field to avoid issues during the update.
8. Test the Entire Flow

End-to-End Testing: After making the necessary changes, perform end-to-end testing to ensure that the entire flow works as expected. This includes creating, updating, and deleting projects with the new buttons field.
9. Documentation

Update Documentation: Ensure that any changes to the API, database schema, or frontend logic are well-documented. This will help prevent similar issues in the future and make it easier for other developers to understand the system.
10. Rollback Plan

Backup: Before making any changes to the database or backend, ensure that you have a backup in case something goes wrong.
Rollback Strategy: Have a rollback strategy in place to revert changes if the update causes unexpected issues.
